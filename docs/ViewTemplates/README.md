# View templates

Waigo uses [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) (formerly Jade) as its default templating language. Pug templates use a concise syntax which results in minimal errors and well-formed, minified output code for maximum efficiency usage from both a bandwidth and page rendering perspective.

Templates are used for both rendering pages and emails. Page templates can be found under the `/src/views` path. Email templates are under the `/src/emails` path.
